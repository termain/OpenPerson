OpenPerson
==========

An experiment in online presence.

The idea here is to share the part of my public repository that's suitable for public consumption. Scripts, essays, some config files and the like. Stuff I'd like to share, but am too lazy to go through the trouble of putting in the right places.

I'll also include some infrastructure scripting and the like for maintaining such a system and integrating it with a personal wiki, automatic checkins, etc.
