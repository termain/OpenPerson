OpenPerson
==========

An experiment in online presence.

The idea here is to share the part of my public repository that's suitable for public consumption. Scripts, essays, some config files and the like. Stuff I'd like to share, but am too lazy to go through the trouble of putting in the right places.

I'll also include some infrastructure scripting and the like for maintaining such a system and integrating it with a personal wiki, automatic checkins, etc.

Current Layout
==============
* `infrastructure/` -- directory containing the scripts for automating OpenPerson
* `documents/` -- Directory of documents of various types, including essays and lists
* `scripts/` -- Directory general scripts I use
* `profiles/` -- Directory of profiles like `.bash_profile`
